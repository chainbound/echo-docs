# Our Commitment
-------
## Accessibility

_Chainbound has strategically chosen to offer Echo **free of charge** as part of a forward-thinking initiative to capture a significant market share._  


This move not only showcases **our commitment to serving the community** but is also an investment in establishing Echo as a dominant player in the industry. 
We believe that by fostering a widespread user base now, we set the foundation for long-term growth and success.

-----------------------
## Integrity
Echo, and the whole Chainbound team, is committed to integrity.
Users should maintain the same trust expectations they currently hold when directly submitting to block builders.  

We assure all users that we will not engage, nor have the ability to **frontrun** or **unbudle** submitted bundles. 
Our priority is to maintain trust and transparency in every operations.

### Latency

Echo ensures a level playing field for all users by not introducing any artificial latency. Everyone is treated uniformly and fairly.

### Counterparties
Echo's functionality **deeply relies on the actions of block builders and validators.** 
Any transactions or bundles channeled through Echo are exposed to the same threats as those sent directly to block builders or validators.

Chainbound vigilantly observes counterparties activities. Any entity exhibiting antagonistic actions towards our users faces exclusion from the platform.

## Data Policy
Chainbound operates with a clear and purpose-driven data policy. We exclusively record user data with the intent to refine and enhance their trading experiences. 
This data-driven approach serves a dual purpose:
- Firstly, it allows us to continually tailor our platform to better suit the needs of our users. 
- Secondly, it provides the foundation for a robust reputation mechanism for builders. 

By monitoring and assessing builders' performance and behaviors based on real-time user interactions, 
we aim to build a transparent and trustworthy environment for all our stakeholders. The commitment is always towards an optimized, user-centric platform.  

_Analytics will not be available on Echo V 0.1.0, users should expect integration from V 0.2.0 onwards_

Presently, Echo retains the following data in its cache:

- RLP-encoded, signed transactions along with their ordering inside MEV bundles
- Block builder response objects and error messages (when available)


:::warning
Echo respects user privacy by neither storing IP addresses nor tracking users' locations.
