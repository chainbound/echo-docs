# Pricing
We have 2 plans: [Basic](#fiber-basic) and [Professional](#fiber-professional). Basic will give you access to only 1 stream at a time, while with Professional you can use 3.
There are no other differences.
Both plans can be used in all of the [regions](/docs/regions.md). There is also an [option](#additional-streams) to buy additional streams separately.

:::info
We have a 5 day refund period. Contact me on Discord at @mempirate | Chainbound#8926 if you want to try it out.
