## MEV
The main use case for Fiber today is using it as a tool for finding and capturing [MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/mev/). 
Having low latency access to mempool transactions gives you an edge over the competition, even with tools like [MEV-Boost](https://boost.flashbots.net/) becoming dominant.
Example MEV strategies could be
* Arbitrage
* Liquidity Sniping
* NFT Sniping
* Liquidations
* PGAs (Priority Gas Auctions)

## Fast, reliable and wide mempool access without infrastructure
Because Fiber provides an API for streaming transactions, you don't need any infrastructure like full nodes yourself. On top of that,
you'll see more transactions than you usually would, and faster, because of the global reach of Fiber Network. 

One customer uses this feature to build Telegram bots that track the early stages of newly launched tokens on DEXes.
